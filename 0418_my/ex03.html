            Party's over now
You're still hovering above my eyes
I'm yellin' out loud
There's isn't any voice any sound
Did I make u or not
Am I mad but Im not
I can see u clearly but they deny
Your touch still remain on my mouth
I can still hear your sound
No doubt, no doubt
I'm so awkward with this emotion
Something bother me there's no options
I feel like a shaman or mad man
Illusion standing on all the wall like a
Ghost
Oh oh I can see you ghost
Ghost
Please don't leave me my ghost
You don't need to hide I already know this
Just let me feel you all night long
You make me feel like a chosen one
If you want I can sell my soul for ya
Ghost, ghost, ghost, ghost
I'm waiting for you in a room no light
Then I think I can see your shape more bright
At the corner there's some silhouette
I'm pretty god damn sure it is you, my ghost
I'm perfectly sober
Don't treat me like a bad tripper
I'm perfectly normal
Don't judge my symptoms, need no doctor
Did I swear u or not
Can't remember it's like
These days hard to focus on something
Did I tell you or not
Honestly I'm waiting for
Tonight tonight
I'm so awkward with this emotion
Something bother me there's no options
I feel like a shaman or mad man
Illusion standing on all the wall like a
Ghost
Oh oh I can see you ghost
Ghost
Please don't leave me my ghost
You don't need to hide I already know this
Just let me feel you all night long
You make me feel like a chosen one
If you want I can sell my soul for ya
Ghost, ghost, ghost, ghost
I'm waiting for you in a room no light
Then I think I can see your shape more bright
At the corner there's some silhouette
I'm pretty god damn sure it is you, my ghost
